<p>I am student currently studying a <strong>BSc Audio Engineering</strong> in the UK. I am about all things FOSS, Libre, Linux and anything else that sounds complex.</p>

<p>My past time normally involves trying to do something clever with my computer, breaking and then fixing it again (normally learning an enormous amount in the process).</p>
