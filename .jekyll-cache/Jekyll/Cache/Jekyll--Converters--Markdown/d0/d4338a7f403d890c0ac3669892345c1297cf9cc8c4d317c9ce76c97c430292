I"ð<p>I never really thought about making a blog, until a friend asked me how to make one. I have settled on the use of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for creating my site due to its intergration with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and use of markdown language.</p>

<p>As someone who (now having discovered markdown) has started to dislike the complexity and clutter of a program like microsoft word, this solution is near perfect. It allows me to litterally copy and paste my work into a blog post and it just work!</p>

<p>$\frac{d}{t}$</p>

<p>So stay tuned, buckel up and possibly even subscribe to my <a href="/_site/feed.xml">RSS feed</a> (if thatâ€™s something people still do)!</p>
