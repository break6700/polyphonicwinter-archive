I never really thought about making a blog, until a friend asked me how to make one. I have settled on the use of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for creating my site due to its intergration with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and use of markdown language.

As someone who (now having discovered markdown) has started to dislike the complexity and clutter of a program like microsoft word, this solution is near perfect. It allows me to litterally copy and paste my work into a blog post and it just work![^1]

Look pretty $$\LaTeX$$ support with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)!

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}
$$
