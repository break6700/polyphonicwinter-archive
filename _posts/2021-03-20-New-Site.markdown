I never really thought about making a blog, until a friend asked me how to make one. I have settled on the use of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for creating my site due to its intergration with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and use of markdown language.

As someone who (now having discovered markdown) has started to dislike the complexity and clutter of a program like microsoft word, this solution is near perfect. It allows me to litterally copy and paste my work into a blog post and it just work!

$\frac{d}{t}$


So stay tuned, buckel up and possibly even subscribe to my [RSS feed](/_site/feed.xml) (if that's something people still do)!
